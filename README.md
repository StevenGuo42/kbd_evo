# KBD Evo (WIP)

### Searching effective keyboard layout using evolutionary algorithm

## Requirements

- [kle-py](https://github.com/DamSenViet/kle-py) and [kle-json](https://github.com/DamSenViet/kle-json) for loading the keyboard layout

    If `kle-json` did not autometicly install with `kle-py`, put the `kle-json` folder under `/kle-py/damsenviet/kle/` directory

## Data
The key press rate, flexibility, and effectiveness of each finger are taken from the following paper:
- [An Estimation of Finger-Tapping Rates and Load Capacities and the Effects of Various Factors](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0018720814563976)
- [Neuromuscular and biomechanical functions subserving finger dexterity in musicians](https://doi.org/10.1038%2Fs41598-019-48718-9)
